# **App Name**: Doodle Dash

## Core Features:

- Real-time Drawing: Enable users to draw in real-time on a shared canvas.
- Word Generation: Generate a word for the user to draw using AI. The AI tool will first determine an appropriate word based on recent game history, as well as the skill level of the player, to select words that provide adequate, but not excessive, challenge. The tool can then provide words and prevent duplicate words from being used within a certain duration of gameplay.
- Guessing Functionality: Allow other players to guess the drawing in real-time using a chat interface.
- Scoreboard: Keep track of the scores of all players in the game.
- Turn Management: Manage turns by selecting a player to draw for each round.
- User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and log in to the game.
- Room Management: Allow users to create private rooms to play with friends.
